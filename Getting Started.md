## Purpose
The purpose of this Obsidian Vault is to provide guidance on how to advance one's skills as a software development professional. 

This vault is not intended to be exhaustive and is intended to be expanded and contracted based on an individual's interests and career goals.

Rather than give someone a vault that has all of the notes and research completed, the exercise of building the vault is intended to deliver the most value.
