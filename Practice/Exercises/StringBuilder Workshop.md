> PART 1
> - Given a large text file: [https://github.com/dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
> - Write a method that uses StringBuilder to concatenate the contents into a single, ;-delimited line
> - Write another method that does the same thing without StringBuilder (using string concatenation)
> - Time each method using a simple timer and compare
> 
> PART 2
> - Implement the StringBuilder class (for appending strings only)
> - Use the FluentBuilder design pattern
> 
> PART 3
> - Using a performance profiler, quantify the performance difference between the two methods
> - Using a memory profiler, quantify the memory usage difference between the two methods
