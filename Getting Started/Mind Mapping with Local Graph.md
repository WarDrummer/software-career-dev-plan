## Overview

Mind maps are a tool for visualizing information hierarchically as well as how it relates to other information.

Using the *Local Graph* feature in Obsidian, we can create Mind Maps that help us organize and relate data for different areas we're exploring and learning about.

## Creating a New Mind Map

1. Create a new folder, e.g. "Structural Patterns"
2. Within the folder, create a note with the same name, e.g. "Structural Patterns"
	- This note can serve as the central concept of the mind map
	- This note can also serve as a Table of Contents for the central concept
3. In the new note (central concept note), create links for connecting nodes in the mind map
	- `[[Adapter]]`, `[[Bridge]]`, etc.
4. Click on links to create notes for each sub-concept in the folder alongside the central concept note
	- The new notes should appear in this location, automatically. If not, [[Default Location for New Notes|check your settings]]
5. Open the mind map by clicking the vertical elllipsis in the central concept note and selecting "Open Local Graph"
	- You can click on nodes to change the open note, which also updates the focus of the graph
