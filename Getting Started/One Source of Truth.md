# One Source of Truth

## Overview
For any given topic (e.g. Test-Driven Development, Law of Demeter, etc.), have a single note to aggregate information

## Transclusion
Use transclusion to aggregate information from other sources
- Example: `![[PRGP01 - Bend or Break#Law of Demeter]]`
- `!` includes the contents of the passage from another note in this note
- `#Law of Demeter` limits the scope to a heading within a note
